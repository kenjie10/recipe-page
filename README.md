### What I learned

I used clamp() for font responsiveness and it lessen the need to change font-size of every media queries.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
  font-size: clamp(16px, 2vw , 35px);   
}
```

### Continued development

lessen the css code line 


### Useful resources
- [Example resource 1](https://www.W3school.com) - This  helped me when i forgot some css code usage. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
